                        and Pfizer regarding this Site and supersede any and all other agreements, representations and understandings,
                        whether written or oral. These Terms of Use may not be modified or amended by you without the prior written consent
                        of Pfizer. Pfizer may modify or amend these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you.
                        You should regularly review these Terms of Use for any modifications or amendments to these Terms of Use as your
                        continued use of the Site after a modification or amendment signifies your assent and agreement to these Terms of
                        Use, as amended. If any clause or provision set forth in these Terms of Use is determined to be illegal, invalid or
                        unenforceable under present or future law, then you understand and agree that the clause or provision so determined
                        to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable will be enforced to the extent permissible and shall be severable without
                        affecting the enforceability of all remaining clauses or provisions, while still as fully as possible carrying out
                        the intent of the original provision. Failure by Pfizer to prosecute any right with respect to a default hereunder
                        will not constitute a waiver by Pfizer of the right to enforce rights with respect to the same or any other
                        breach.</p></div>
