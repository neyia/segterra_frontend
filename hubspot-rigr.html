                        performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and products in development that involve substantial

                        pharmaceutical research and development; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve
                        drug applications and supplemental drug applications as well as their decisions regarding labeling and other matters
                        that could affect the availability or commercial potential of Pfizer products; competitive developments; the ability
                        to successfully market both new and existing products; challenges to the validity and enforcement of Pfizer’s
                        patents; trends toward managed care and health care cost containment; governmental laws and regulations affecting
                        health care, including without limitation regarding pharmaceutical product access, pricing and reimbursement; and
                        general economic conditions, such as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A further list
                        and description of these and other risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in Pfizer’s most recent
                        Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, all of which are available at

                        which are detailed in Pfizer’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Pfizer assumes no
                        obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
